Flashing of Mecrisp-Stellaris to the numworks calculator:

dfu-util -i 0 -a 0 -s 0x08000000 -D mecrisp-stellaris-numworks-with-sources.bin

No need to disassemble your calculator, terminal is on USART6: PA11 = D- = TX. PA12 = D+ = RX.
Just cut an old USB cable and connect it to a USB-serial-brige with 115200 Baud 8N1.

You need to type "eraseflash" once to clear the free dictionary space after you flash the Forth binary,
as dfu-util leaves old contents in flash blocks which are not used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not forget to flash back to Epsilon at the end of the day or connect to a power supply,
as the Forth binary will drain your battery as long as sleep modes are not implemented:

dfu-util -i 0 -a 0 -s 0x08000000 -D epsilon.bin

Epsilon 1.6.0 binary included for convenience purposes only.
